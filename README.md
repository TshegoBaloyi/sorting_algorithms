0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O                                                                                  ln this project we will look at the diffent types of algorithms, the Big O notation, how to evaluate the time complexity on an algorithm and selecting the best sorting algorithm for a given input data set.                                                                                          An algorithm is a coded formula written into software that, when triggered, prompts the tech to take relevant action to solve a problem. Computer algorithms work via input and output. When data is entered, the system analyses the information given and executes the correct commands to produce the desired result.                                                                                                     what is Big O notation                                     -Big O, also known as Big O notation, represents an algorithm's worst-case complexity.                                -It uses algebraic terms to describe the complexity of an algorithm.                                                  -Big O defines the runtime required to execute an algorithm by identifying how the performance of your algorithm will change as the input size grows. But it does not tell you how fast your algorithm's runtime is.                        -Big O notation measures the efficiency and performance of your algorithm using time and space complexity.

There are six major types of complexities(time and space)
constant O(1)
linear time O(n)
logarithmic time O(nlogn)
quadratic time O(n^2)
exponential time O(2^n)
factorial time O(n!
